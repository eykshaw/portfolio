                    <h3>About the Designer</h3>
                    <p>I'm a 4th year designer at UC Davis who is passionate about spacial design and sustainable building. I'm also very interested in the use of biology and biological concepts in design. I aspire to go to graduate school to earn my Masters of Architecture so that I can enter the professional field and influence the world around me with my designs then potentially go back to school to get my PhD researching sustainable buiding methods and building theory.</p>

                            <p>I'm a strong believer that we as humans have a duty to our planet and to each other to keep our planet healthy. Architecture is wonderful in that it tells a story of society through time, from the formality and power of the Roman Empire to the booming growth of the Industrial Revolution. But it also has the ability to shape what is around us and to change the way we look at the world. I want to use my knowledge and creativity to not only tell the story of today but to tell the story of tomorrow. Innovative design is a major contributor to change, and I want to be part of that and to help make a better tomorrow.</p>
