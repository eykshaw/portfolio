                            <p>This poster was made for the final project for Design 16, Graphic Design and Computer Technology. The event that the poster advertises is based on the work of Leonardo Bonacci &#40;more commonly known as Finonnaci&#41;. Fibonnaci is most famous for his mathematical advances, but the theoretical event and therefore this poster focus mainly on his discoveries in relation to the natural world &#40;this the title Numbers in Nature&#41;.</p>

                            <p>The final project event poster was based off of the previous project, which was a poster based on a chosen historical person. This poster, considered to be an early draft of the final project, was less successful at emphasizing the numerical patterns found in nature, so for the final poster the main image was changed, and the images of Fibonnaci's mathematical notes decreased in size.</p>
